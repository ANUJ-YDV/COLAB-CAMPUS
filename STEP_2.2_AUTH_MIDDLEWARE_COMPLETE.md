# Step 2.2: Secure Express Routes - Authentication & Authorization ‚úÖ

## üéØ Objective
Build secure Express routes so users can:
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete their projects
- **Only allow access if they're a member or owner**

---

## ‚úÖ What We've Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Authentication Middleware

**File**: `server/middleware/authmiddleware.js`

#### Three Middleware Functions:

1. **`protect`** - Verifies JWT token and authenticates user
   - Checks for `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
   - Verifies JWT token using JWT_SECRET
   - Fetches user from database (without password)
   - Attaches `req.user` to request object
   - Returns 401 if token is missing/invalid

2. **`checkProjectMembership`** - Ensures user is member or owner
   - Must be used **after** `protect` middleware
   - Checks if user is in `project.members` or is `project.owner`
   - Attaches `req.project` and `req.isOwner` to request
   - Returns 403 if user is not a member

3. **`checkProjectOwnership`** - Ensures user is owner
   - Must be used **after** `protect` middleware  
   - Only allows project owner to proceed
   - Used for delete, add/remove members
   - Returns 403 if user is not the owner

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Secured Project Routes

**File**: `server/routes/projectRoutes.js`

| Route | Method | Protection | Description |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `/create` | POST | `protect` | Create new project (owner = authenticated user) |
| `/my-projects` | GET | `protect` | Get all projects for authenticated user |
| `/user/:userId` | GET | Public | Get user projects (backward compatibility) |
| `/:projectId` | DELETE | `protect` + `checkProjectOwnership` | Delete project (owner only) |
| `/:projectId/members/add` | POST | `protect` + `checkProjectOwnership` | Add member (owner only) |
| `/:projectId/members/remove` | POST | `protect` + `checkProjectOwnership` | Remove member (owner only) |

**Key Changes**:
- ‚úÖ `ownerId` no longer required in request body - uses `req.user._id`
- ‚úÖ New `/my-projects` endpoint for authenticated user
- ‚úÖ All modification operations require owner permission
- ‚úÖ Member management secured

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Secured Task Routes

**File**: `server/routes/taskRoutes.js`

| Route | Method | Protection | Description |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `/create` | POST | `protect` | Create new task (requires auth) |
| `/project/:projectId` | GET | `protect` + `checkProjectMembership` | Get project tasks (members only) |
| `/my-tasks` | GET | `protect` | Get authenticated user's tasks |
| `/user/:userId` | GET | Public | Get user tasks (backward compatibility) |
| `/:taskId/status` | PATCH | `protect` | Update task status |
| `/:taskId/assign` | PATCH | `protect` | Assign task to user |
| `/:taskId/comments` | POST | `protect` | Add comment (author = authenticated user) |
| `/:taskId` | DELETE | `protect` | Delete task |

**Key Changes**:
- ‚úÖ `authorId` no longer required for comments - uses `req.user._id`
- ‚úÖ New `/my-tasks` endpoint for authenticated user
- ‚úÖ Project tasks require membership verification
- ‚úÖ All operations require authentication

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Updated Test File

**File**: `server/test-api.http`

**Updated with**:
- ‚úÖ Instructions to save token from login
- ‚úÖ `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` headers on all protected routes
- ‚úÖ Real IDs from seed data (6900ebd4a6305efc84cffeba, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Comments indicating which routes are protected
- ‚úÖ 18 total test requests with proper authentication

---

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### Authentication
- ‚úÖ JWT token verification on protected routes
- ‚úÖ Token expiration handling (1 hour from login)
- ‚úÖ User lookup without exposing password
- ‚úÖ Proper 401 responses for unauthorized access

### Authorization
- ‚úÖ Membership verification before showing project data
- ‚úÖ Owner-only operations (delete, manage members)
- ‚úÖ Proper 403 responses for forbidden actions
- ‚úÖ Automatic user association (no manual ID passing)

### Data Integrity
- ‚úÖ Authenticated user automatically becomes owner/author
- ‚úÖ Cannot fake ownerId or authorId in requests
- ‚úÖ Project membership checked before task access
- ‚úÖ Consistent error messages

---

## üìã How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
cd "c:\Users\ajydv\OneDrive\Desktop\COLAB CAMPUS\server"
node server.js
```

### Step 2: Login to Get Token
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@collabcampus.com",
  "password": "hashedPlaceholder"
}
```

**Save the token from response!**

### Step 3: Test Protected Endpoints

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in `test-api.http` with your actual token.

**Example: Get My Projects**
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/projects/my-projects
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Example: Create Project**
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/projects/create
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

{
  "name": "My Secure Project",
  "description": "Created with authentication",
  "memberIds": []
}
```

### Step 4: Test Authorization

Try accessing a project you're not a member of ‚Üí Should get `403 Forbidden`

Try deleting a project you don't own ‚Üí Should get `403 Forbidden`

Try accessing without token ‚Üí Should get `401 Unauthorized`

## üÜï New API Endpoints

### For Frontend Integration

1. **GET /api/projects/my-projects** (Protected)
   - Returns all projects where user is owner or member
   - Use this instead of `/user/:userId` for authenticated requests

2. **GET /api/tasks/my-tasks** (Protected)
   - Returns all tasks assigned to authenticated user
   - Use this for user dashboard

---

## üîÑ Migration Guide for Frontend

### Before (Unsecure):
```javascript
// Had to manually pass userId
fetch('/api/projects/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Project",
    ownerId: userId  // ‚ùå Could be faked
  })
})
```

### After (Secure):
```javascript
// Server gets userId from token
fetch('/api/projects/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`  // ‚úÖ Secure
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Project"
    // No ownerId needed!
  })
})
```
