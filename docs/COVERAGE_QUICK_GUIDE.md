# 📊 Quick Coverage Report Guide

## Open Coverage Reports in Browser

### Backend (Server)
```powershell
# Generate and open coverage report
cd server
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
start coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### Frontend (Client)
```powershell
# Generate and open coverage report
cd client
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
start coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## What You'll See

### Coverage Dashboard
- **Overall Stats**: Total coverage percentages
- **File List**: Click any file to see line-by-line coverage
- **Color Coding**:
  - 🟢 **Green**: Code is covered by tests
  - 🔴 **Red**: Code is NOT covered by tests
  - 🟡 **Yellow**: Partially covered (some branches)

### Key Metrics
- **Statements**: Individual code statements executed
- **Branches**: if/else, switch cases, ternary operators
- **Functions**: Function definitions called
- **Lines**: Physical lines of code executed

## Coverage Goals

### Backend Current State
```
Utils:     62.06% - Good (logger, errorHandler well tested)
Models:    17.50% - Needs improvement
Routes:    26.15% - Needs improvement
Server:    13.82% - Needs improvement
```

### Frontend Current State
```
App.jsx:   100%    - Excellent
Pages:     4.10%   - Needs significant improvement
Components: 0%     - Not yet tested
```

## Improving Coverage

### Focus Areas
1. **Controllers** - Add API endpoint tests
2. **Middleware** - Test auth, error handling
3. **Models** - Test validation, virtuals, methods
4. **Components** - Add unit tests for each component
5. **Pages** - Test user interactions, state changes

### Example: Increase Model Coverage
```javascript
// In __tests__/models/user.test.js
describe('User Model', () => {
  it('should hash password before saving', async () => {
    const user = new User({
      name: 'Test User',
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'plaintext'
    });
    
    await user.save();
    expect(user.password).not.toBe('plaintext');
    expect(user.password.length).toBeGreaterThan(30); // bcrypt hash length
  });
});
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
When you push to GitHub, coverage reports are automatically:
1. Generated on each push/PR
2. Uploaded to Codecov (if configured)
3. Displayed as PR comments
4. Tracked over time (trend analysis)

### Codecov Setup (Optional)
1. Go to https://codecov.io
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Enable for your repository
4. Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets
5. Coverage badge will appear in README

## Quick Commands

```powershell
# Backend - Just generate coverage (don't open)
cd server && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Frontend - Just generate coverage
cd client && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Backend - Watch mode with coverage
cd server && npm test -- --coverage

# Frontend - Single test file with coverage
cd client && npm test -- --coverage src/__tests__/Login.test.jsx

# Both - Run all tests in parallel
# Terminal 1:
cd server && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Terminal 2:
cd client && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
```

## Interpreting Results

### Good Coverage (>80%)
✅ File is well-tested
✅ Most code paths validated
✅ Confident in refactoring

### Moderate Coverage (50-80%)
⚠️ Some tests exist
⚠️ Key paths tested, edge cases missing
⚠️ Add more tests

### Low Coverage (<50%)
❌ Insufficient testing
❌ High risk of bugs
❌ Priority: Add tests

## Next Steps After Viewing

1. **Identify red/yellow files** in coverage report
2. **Write tests** for uncovered code
3. **Re-run coverage** to see improvement
4. **Commit new tests** to Git
5. **Watch CI/CD** run and verify coverage increases
