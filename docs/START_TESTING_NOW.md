```
🧪 S3 Upload Test
Test the secure S3 pre-signed URL upload workflow
```

### Step 4: Upload a File
1. **Click "Choose File"** button
2. **Select any file** (image, PDF, etc.)
3. **Click "Upload to S3"** button
4. **Watch progress**: 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
5. **Success!** You'll see the S3 URL

### Step 5: Verify Upload

#### In Browser:
- ✅ Success message shows
- ✅ File URL is displayed
- ✅ Click URL to open file in new tab
- ✅ Click "Copy URL" to copy link

#### In Backend Terminal:
Look for these logs:
```
✅ Generated presigned URL for: yourfile.jpg

```

**Important:** You should NOT see binary file data in logs!

#### In AWS S3 Console:
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. Region: **Asia Pacific (Mumbai) ap-south-1**
3. Bucket: **collabcampus-storage**
4. Folder: **uploads/**
5. Your file: `1730300000000-yourfile.jpg`

## 🔍 What to Check

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- [ ] File selected shows size (e.g., "245.6 KB")
- [ ] Progress bar moves smoothly 0% → 100%
- [ ] Upload completes in < 10 seconds
- [ ] Green success message appears
- [ ] S3 URL is clickable and works
- [ ] Backend logs show "Generated presigned URL"
- [ ] Backend logs show "File upload confirmed"
- [ ] NO binary data in backend logs
- [ ] File appears in S3 Console

### ❌ Common Issues:

**"Failed to get presigned URL"**
- Check backend is running (Terminal 1)
- Verify http://localhost:5000 is accessible

**CORS Error**
- Apply CORS config from `server/utils/s3-cors-config.json`
- See `S3_CORS_SETUP.md` for instructions

**"Upload failed at 50%"**
- Check AWS credentials in `server/.env`
- Verify S3 bucket name is correct

## 📊 Performance Test

Try these:

### Test 1: Small Image
```
File: photo.jpg (500 KB)
Expected: < 3 seconds
```

### Test 2: Medium PDF
```
File: document.pdf (2 MB)
Expected: < 5 seconds
```

### Test 3: Large Video
```
File: video.mp4 (8 MB)
Expected: < 10 seconds
```

## 🎯 What You'll Observe

### Direct S3 Upload:
Open **Browser DevTools** (F12) → Network tab

You'll see 3 requests:

1. **GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/upload/presign`
   - Response: `{ "uploadUrl": "https://...", "key": "..." }`

2. **PUT** `https://collabcampus-storage.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/...`
   - ⚠️ Notice: Goes to **s3.amazonaws.com**, NOT localhost!
   - This is the direct upload bypassing your server

3. **POST** `http://localhost:5000/api/upload/confirm`
   - Response: `{ "success": true, "fileUrl": "..." }`

### Server Logs:
```
✅ Generated presigned URL for: test.jpg
📦 File upload confirmed: test.jpg (512000 bytes)
```

**Key Point:** No file content, just metadata!
