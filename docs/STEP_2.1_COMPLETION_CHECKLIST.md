# Step 2.1 Completion Checklist âœ…

## âœ… 1. Project.js Model
- [x] File created at `server/models/project.js`
- [x] Schema includes: name, description, owner, members[], tasks[]
- [x] Timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt
- [x] Pre-save hook for updatedAt
- [x] ObjectId references to User and Task models
- [x] **Index added**: `{ members: 1 }` for member queries
- [x] Exported as mongoose model

## âœ… 2. Task.js Model
- [x] File created at `server/models/task.js`
- [x] Schema includes: title, description, status, project, assignedTo, dueDate, priority, comments[]
- [x] Status enum: ["todo", "in-progress", "done"]
- [x] Priority enum: ["low", "medium", "high"]
- [x] Comments subdocument with author, message, createdAt
- [x] Pre-save hook for updatedAt
- [x] **Index added**: `{ project: 1, status: 1 }` for Kanban queries
- [x] Exported as mongoose model

## âœ… 3. User.js Updated
- [x] Added `projects` array field
- [x] ObjectId references to Project model
- [x] Synced via controllers (addToSet, pull operations)

## âœ… 4. Controllers Created
### projectController.js
- [x] createProject - Creates project and adds to user.projects
- [x] deleteProject - Cascade deletes tasks
- [x] addMember - Syncs both Project.members and User.projects
- [x] removeMember - Removes from both sides
- [x] getUserProjects - Gets all projects for a user

### taskController.js
- [x] createTask - Creates task and adds to Project.tasks
- [x] updateTaskStatus - Updates task status
- [x] assignTaskToUser - Assigns user to task
- [x] addCommentToTask - Adds comment to task
- [x] deleteTask - Removes task and updates Project.tasks
- [x] getProjectTasks - Gets all tasks for project (with populate)
- [x] getUserTasks - Gets all tasks assigned to user

## âœ… 5. Routes Created
### projectRoutes.js
- [x] POST /api/projects/create
- [x] GET /api/projects/user/:userId
- [x] DELETE /api/projects/:projectId
- [x] POST /api/projects/:projectId/members/add
- [x] POST /api/projects/:projectId/members/remove

### taskRoutes.js
- [x] POST /api/tasks/create
- [x] GET /api/tasks/project/:projectId
- [x] GET /api/tasks/user/:userId
- [x] PATCH /api/tasks/:taskId/status
- [x] PATCH /api/tasks/:taskId/assign
- [x] POST /api/tasks/:taskId/comments
- [x] DELETE /api/tasks/:taskId

## âœ… 6. Seed Script
- [x] File created at `server/seeds/seed.js`
- [x] Creates test user: test@collabcampus.com
- [x] Creates demo project: "Demo Project"
- [x] Creates 2 tasks: "Design README", "Create Kanban UI"
- [x] Links tasks to project (Project.tasks array)
- [x] Links project to user (User.projects array)
- [x] Assigns user to one task
- [x] **Verified in MongoDB Atlas** âœ…

## âœ… 7. Query Validation
- [x] Test script created: `server/test-queries.js`
- [x] **Query 1**: Get all tasks for project with populated assignedTo
  ```javascript
  Task.find({ project: projectId }).populate("assignedTo", "name email")
  ```
- [x] **Query 2**: Get project with tasks populated (nested)
  ```javascript
  Project.findById(projectId).populate({
    path: "tasks",
    populate: { path: "assignedTo", select: "name email" }
  })
  ```
- [x] **Query 3**: Get all tasks assigned to user across projects
  ```javascript
  Task.find({ assignedTo: userId }).populate("project", "name")
  ```
- [x] **Bonus Query**: Get user with projects populated
  ```javascript
  User.findById(userId).populate("projects", "name description")
  ```
- [x] All queries tested and working âœ…

## âœ… 8. Indexing & Performance
- [x] Task index: `{ project: 1, status: 1 }` - Speeds up Kanban queries
- [x] Project index: `{ members: 1 }` - Speeds up member queries
- [x] Rationale documented: Avoid over-embedding, separate collections for scalability

## âœ… 9. Security & Data Integrity Notes
- [x] Mongoose validators on required fields
- [x] Enum validators on status and priority
- [x] Controllers sync both sides of relationships (User.projects â†” Project.members)
- [x] Controllers use $addToSet to prevent duplicates
- [x] Cascade delete implemented (delete project â†’ delete tasks)
- [ ] **TODO in Step 2.2**: Add middleware to validate user membership before operations
- [ ] **TODO**: Implement transactions for multi-document updates
- [ ] **TODO**: Add authorization checks in routes

## âœ… 10. Files Created/Modified Summary

### New Files Created (8):
1. `server/models/project.js` - Project schema with indexes
2. `server/models/task.js` - Task schema with indexes
3. `server/controllers/projectController.js` - Project business logic
4. `server/controllers/taskController.js` - Task business logic
5. `server/routes/projectRoutes.js` - Project API routes
6. `server/routes/taskRoutes.js` - Task API routes
7. `server/seeds/seed.js` - Database seeding script
8. `server/test-queries.js` - Query validation tests

### Modified Files (3):

## ðŸ“Š Database Status
- **Users**: 3 (including seeded test user)
- **Projects**: 1 (Demo Project)
- **Tasks**: 2 (Design README, Create Kanban UI)
- **All relationships verified**: User â†” Project â†” Task

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Step 2.2)

- [ ] Add membership validation middleware
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add request validation (express-validator)
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Implement transactions for critical operations

## âœ… STEP 2.1 - FULLY COMPLETED!

All models, controllers, routes, seeds, queries, and indexes are implemented and tested.
Ready to proceed to Step 2.2: Security & Middleware Implementation.
