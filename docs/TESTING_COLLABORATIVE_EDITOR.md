---

## 🎯 Test 1: Single User Basic Test

### Objective: Verify basic editor functionality

1. **Login**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/login
   - Login with test user credentials

2. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Should see your projects

3. **Open Document Editor**
   - URL pattern: `http://localhost:3000/project/{projectId}/document`
   - Replace `{projectId}` with actual project ID
   
   **How to get projectId:**
   - Open browser DevTools → Console
   - In Dashboard, inspect project card
   - Or check MongoDB: `db.projects.find()`

4. **Test Editor**
   - [ ] Page loads successfully
   - [ ] See "Connected" status (green dot)
   - [ ] Type some text
   - [ ] See text appear in editor
   - [ ] Watch console: "💾 Auto-saving document..."
   - [ ] Wait 5 seconds → "Last saved" timestamp updates

5. **Test Persistence**
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - [ ] Your text should still be there
   - [ ] Console shows: "📄 Document loaded"

✅ **PASS**: If all checkboxes complete

## 🎉 Test 2: Multi-User Real-Time Collaboration (The Main Event!)

### Objective: Test real-time sync between users

### Setup

**Browser 1 (Chrome - User A):**
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Login as User A
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/project/{projectId}/document`
4. Open DevTools Console (F12)

**Browser 2 (Firefox or Incognito - User B):**
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Login as **different** user (User B)
3. Navigate to **SAME URL**: `http://localhost:3000/project/{projectId}/document`
4. Open DevTools Console (F12)

### Test Sequence

#### Part A: User A Types First

1. **User A**: Type "Hello from User A!"
   
   **Expected Results:**
   - [ ] Text appears in User A's editor
   - [ ] **User B sees "Hello from User A!" appear INSTANTLY** ✨
   - [ ] User A console: "📝 Received changes from: User B" (if B typed)
   - [ ] User B console: "📝 Received changes from: User A"

#### Part B: User B Responds

2. **User B**: Type "Hello from User B!"
   
   **Expected Results:**
   - [ ] Text appears in User B's editor
   - [ ] **User A sees "Hello from User B!" appear INSTANTLY** ✨
   - [ ] Both editors show same content

#### Part C: Simultaneous Editing

3. **Both Users**: Type at the same time
   
   **Expected Results:**
   - [ ] Both see each other's changes
   - [ ] Text merges (last-write-wins)
   - [ ] No crashes or errors

#### Part D: Auto-Save Test

4. **Both Users**: Stop typing
   - Wait 5 seconds
   
   **Expected Results:**
   - [ ] Both console logs show: "💾 Auto-saving document..."
   - [ ] Both see updated "Last saved" timestamp
   - [ ] Version number increments (if visible)

#### Part E: Persistence Test

5. **User A**: Refresh page (F5)
   
   **Expected Results:**
   - [ ] All content persists
   - [ ] User A reconnects
   - [ ] User B still sees real-time updates from User A

6. **User B**: Close browser tab completely
   
   **Expected Results:**
   - [ ] User A console shows: "User left" or similar
   - [ ] User A can still type and save

7. **User B**: Reopen and navigate back
   
   **Expected Results:**
   - [ ] Sees all content that was saved
   - [ ] Real-time sync resumes

✅ **PASS**: If all checkboxes complete

## 🔬 Test 3: Edge Cases

### Test 3A: Network Disconnection

1. **User A**: Open document
2. **Stop backend server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
3. **User A**: Try typing
   
   **Expected:**
   - [ ] Status changes to "Disconnected" (red dot)
   - [ ] Text still appears locally
   - [ ] Console shows connection error

4. **Restart backend server**
   
   **Expected:**
   - [ ] Status changes back to "Connected" (green dot)
   - [ ] User can continue editing

### Test 3B: Invalid Project ID

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/project/invalid-id-123/document`
   
   **Expected:**
   - [ ] Error handling (redirect to dashboard or error message)
   - [ ] No crashes

### Test 3C: Unauthorized Access

1. Login as User A
2. Try accessing project where User A is NOT a member
   
   **Expected:**
   - [ ] Access denied message
   - [ ] Or redirect to dashboard

### Test 3D: Large Document

1. Paste a large text (1000+ words)
   
   **Expected:**
   - [ ] Editor handles it smoothly
   - [ ] Real-time sync still works
   - [ ] Auto-save completes

✅ **PASS**: If all edge cases handled gracefully

---

## 📊 Test 4: Performance Test

### Test Load with Multiple Users

**Setup:**
- Open document in 5+ browser tabs (different users if possible)
- All editing simultaneously

**Metrics to Check:**
- [ ] UI remains responsive
- [ ] Changes sync within 1 second
- [ ] No memory leaks (check DevTools → Performance)
- [ ] Server doesn't crash

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Disconnected" Status

**Symptoms:**
- Red dot showing
- No real-time sync

**Debugging:**
1. Check backend running: `http://localhost:5000`
2. Check console for errors
3. Verify token exists: `localStorage.getItem('token')`
4. Check Socket.io connection: Look for "🟢 Socket connected" in console

**Solution:**
- Restart backend
- Clear localStorage and re-login
- Check firewall/antivirus blocking WebSocket

---

### Issue 2: Changes Not Syncing

**Symptoms:**
- User A types but User B doesn't see changes

**Debugging:**
1. Both users on same `projectId`?
2. Check console for "📝 Received changes" messages
3. Check network tab → WS (WebSocket) connection

**Solution:**
- Verify both joined same document room
- Check server logs for errors
- Restart both browsers

---

### Issue 3: Document Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Editor shows blank
- Console shows "Document not found"

**Debugging:**
1. Verify project exists: `GET /api/projects/{projectId}`
2. Check user is project member
3. Check MongoDB: `db.documents.find({ projectId: ObjectId('...') })`

**Solution:**
- Create document first (auto-created on first join)
- Verify project membership
- Check backend logs

---

### Issue 4: Auto-Save Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- "Last saved" timestamp not updating

**Debugging:**
1. Check console for "💾 Auto-saving" logs
2. Check server logs for "Document saved" messages
3. Verify MongoDB connection

**Solution:**
- Check 5-second interval is running
- Verify socket connection
- Check MongoDB write permissions

---

## 📝 Expected Console Logs

### When Page Loads:
```
🟢 Socket connected: abc123xyz
📄 Joining document: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
📄 Document loaded: { content: "...", title: "..." }
```

### When Typing:
```
📝 Received changes from: User A
```

### Every 5 Seconds:
```
💾 Auto-saving document...
💾 Document saved (v5)
```

### When Leaving:
```
📄 Leaving document
🔌 Cleaning up socket connection
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your implementation is **successful** if:

1. **Real-Time Sync**: ✅
   - Changes appear instantly in other users' editors (< 1 second delay)

2. **Persistence**: ✅
   - Content survives page refresh
   - Content survives server restart (if MongoDB still has it)

3. **Multi-User**: ✅
   - 2+ users can edit simultaneously
   - All see same final content

4. **Auto-Save**: ✅
   - Document saves every 5 seconds automatically
   - Timestamp updates

5. **Connection Handling**: ✅
   - Shows connection status
   - Handles disconnects gracefully
   - Reconnects automatically

6. **No Crashes**: ✅
   - No console errors
   - No server crashes
   - Handles edge cases

## 🎬 Demo Script (For Showing Others)

### 30-Second Demo:

1. Open document in Chrome as User A
2. Open **same** document in Firefox as User B
3. **User A**: Type "Watch this magic!"
4. **Point to User B's screen**: Text appears instantly!
5. **User B**: Type "Wow! This is amazing!"
6. **Point to User A's screen**: Text appears instantly!
7. Say: "And it auto-saves every 5 seconds!"

**Result**: 🤯 Mind = Blown
