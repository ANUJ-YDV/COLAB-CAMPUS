# 🧪 S3 Upload Testing Guide - Step by Step

## 📋 What We'll Test

1. ✅ Backend generates presigned URLs
2. ✅ Frontend uploads directly to S3
3. ✅ File appears in S3 bucket
4. ✅ No file data in server logs (server bypassed)
5. ✅ Upload completes in seconds

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Start Backend Server

### Open Terminal 1 (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Navigate to server directory
cd "C:\Users\ajydv\OneDrive\Desktop\COLAB CAMPUS\server"

# Start backend with nodemon (auto-reload)
npm run dev
```

**OR use regular start:**
```powershell
npm start
```

### ✅ Expected Output:
```
Environment variables loaded:
MONGO_URI: ✓ Loaded
PORT: 5000
JWT_SECRET: ✓ Loaded
AWS_REGION: ✓ Loaded
AWS_BUCKET_NAME: ✓ Loaded

🔍 Testing S3 Connection...
Region: ap-south-1
Bucket: collabcampus-storage
✅ S3 Connected Successfully!
📦 Available Buckets:
   ✓ collabcampus-storage (TARGET)
✅ Target bucket found and accessible!
✅ MongoDB connected
🚀 Server and Socket.io running on port 5000
```

### ⚠️ If You See Errors:

**Error: "AWS credentials not loaded"**
- Check `server/.env` has all AWS variables
- Restart terminal and try again

**Error: "Port 5000 already in use"**
```powershell
# Kill process on port 5000
Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000).OwningProcess -Force

# Then restart server
npm run dev
```

---

## 🎨 Step 2: Start Frontend Server

### Open Terminal 2 (NEW PowerShell Window)

```powershell
# Navigate to client directory
cd "C:\Users\ajydv\OneDrive\Desktop\COLAB CAMPUS\client"

# Start React app
npm start
```

### ✅ Expected Output:
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.x.x:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully
```

### 🌐 Browser Opens Automatically
- URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- If not, manually open: http://localhost:3000

---

## 🔐 Step 3: Login to App

### Option A: Use Existing Account
If you have a test account, login normally.

### Option B: Create Test Account
1. Click **"Sign Up"** or navigate to http://localhost:3000/signup

   - Name: `Test User`
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. Click **"Sign Up"**
4. You'll be redirected to Dashboard

---

## 📤 Step 4: Navigate to Upload Test

### You Should See:
- **Your Projects** heading
- **🧪 S3 Upload Test** section (blue background)
- File uploader component with:
  - "Choose File" button
  - "Upload to S3" button (disabled until file selected)
  - Instructions at the bottom

---

## 📁 Step 5: Select a Test File

### Choose Any File:
1. Click **"Choose File"** button
2. Select a file from your computer:
   - **Recommended:** Small image (JPG/PNG) < 5MB
   - **Also works:** PDF, video, any file type

### ✅ After Selection:
You'll see:
```
📄 yourfile.jpg (245.6 KB)
```

The **"Upload to S3"** button is now enabled (blue).

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Upload File

### Click "Upload to S3" Button

### Watch Progress:
1. **25%** - "Requesting presigned URL..."
2. **50%** - "Uploading to S3..."
3. **75%** - "Confirming upload..."
4. **100%** - "Upload complete!"

### ⏱️ Timing:
- Small files (< 1MB): **1-3 seconds**
- Medium files (1-5MB): **3-8 seconds**
- Large files (5-10MB): **8-15 seconds**

---

## ✅ Step 7: Verify Success in Browser

### Success Message Appears:
```
✅ File uploaded successfully!

https://collabcampus-storage.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/1730300000000-yourfile.jpg

[📋 Copy URL]
```

### Test the URL:
1. **Click the URL** - Opens file in new tab
2. **Click "Copy URL"** - Copies to clipboard
3. File should be visible/downloadable

---

## 🖥️ Step 8: Check Server Logs (Terminal 1)

### Go Back to Backend Terminal

### ✅ What You SHOULD See:
```
✅ Generated presigned URL for: yourfile.jpg
📦 File upload confirmed: yourfile.jpg (251578 bytes)
```

### ✅ What You SHOULD NOT See:
- ❌ No binary file data
- ❌ No "receiving file chunks" messages
- ❌ No large data dumps

### 🎯 Key Point:
The server **only generates URLs** and **logs metadata**.
The actual file data **never touches your server** - it goes **directly to S3**!

---

## ☁️ Step 9: Verify in AWS S3 Console

### Open AWS Console:
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. Login with your AWS credentials
3. **Region:** Select **Asia Pacific (Mumbai) ap-south-1**

### Navigate to Bucket:
1. Click on bucket: **collabcampus-storage**
2. Click on folder: **uploads/**
3. You should see your file:
   ```
   1730300000000-yourfile.jpg
   ```
   (Timestamp will be different - current Unix timestamp)

### File Details:
- **Size:** Matches original file size
- **Type:** Matches original file type
- **Last Modified:** Just now

### Download to Verify:
1. Click on the file name
2. Click **"Download"** or **"Open"**
3. Verify it's the same file you uploaded

---

## 🧪 Step 10: Run Multiple Tests

### Test Different File Types:

#### Test 1: Image File
```
📷 Upload: photo.jpg (500 KB)
✅ Expected: Success, viewable in browser
```

#### Test 2: PDF Document
```
📄 Upload: document.pdf (1.2 MB)
✅ Expected: Success, opens in PDF viewer
```

#### Test 3: Video File (if < 10MB)
```
🎥 Upload: video.mp4 (8 MB)
✅ Expected: Success, playable in browser
```

#### Test 4: Large File (test timeout)
```
📦 Upload: large-file.zip (50 MB)
⚠️ Expected: May fail if > 60 seconds
Note: Presigned URL expires after 60s
```

---

## 🔍 Step 11: Verify Direct Upload (Technical)

### Open Browser DevTools:
1. Press **F12** or **Right-click → Inspect**
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Keep it open during upload

### Upload Another File

### Check Network Requests:

#### Request 1: Presigned URL
```
GET /api/upload/presign?fileName=test.jpg&fileType=image/jpeg
Status: 200 OK
Response: { "uploadUrl": "https://...", "key": "uploads/..." }
```

#### Request 2: S3 Upload
```
PUT https://collabcampus-storage.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/...
Status: 200 OK
Domain: ⚠️ s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com (NOT localhost:5000!)
```

#### Request 3: Confirm Upload
```
POST /api/upload/confirm
Status: 200 OK
Response: { "success": true, "fileUrl": "https://..." }
```

### 🎯 Key Observation:
The **PUT request goes directly to S3**, not through your backend!

---

## 📊 Step 12: Performance Comparison

### With Pre-Signed URLs (Current):
```
File: 5MB image
Time: ~5 seconds
Server CPU: ~2%
Server Memory: No change
Server Bandwidth: ~1KB (just URL)
```

### Without Pre-Signed URLs (Traditional):
```
File: 5MB image  
Time: ~15-20 seconds
Server CPU: ~30-50%
Server Memory: +5MB
Server Bandwidth: 5MB upload + 5MB to S3 = 10MB
```

### 🚀 Result:
- **3-4x faster** uploads
- **99.98% less server load**
- **Better scalability**

---

## ❌ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Failed to get presigned URL"

**Symptoms:** Upload fails at 25%

**Causes:**
- Backend not running
- Wrong backend URL

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Check backend is running
cd server
npm run dev

# Verify http://localhost:5000 is accessible
```

---

### Issue 2: CORS Error in Browser Console

**Symptoms:**
```
Access to fetch at 'https://collabcampus-storage.s3...' 
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Fix:**
1. Open AWS Console → S3
2. Select `collabcampus-storage`
3. Go to **Permissions** tab
4. Scroll to **CORS**
5. Paste contents from `server/utils/s3-cors-config.json`
6. Save and try again

---

### Issue 3: "SignatureDoesNotMatch"

**Symptoms:** Upload fails at 50% (S3 rejects upload)

**Causes:**
- Wrong AWS secret key
- File type mismatch

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Verify credentials in .env
cd server
notepad .env

# Check these variables:
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
# AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
```

---

### Issue 4: File Uploads but URL Not Accessible

**Symptoms:** Upload succeeds, but clicking URL shows "Access Denied"

**Causes:**
- Bucket not public
- Object not public

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Option 1: Make bucket objects public by default
# (AWS Console → Bucket → Permissions → Public Access Settings)

# Option 2: Add public-read ACL to upload
# Edit server/routes/uploadRoutes.js:
# Add: ACL: 'public-read' to PutObjectCommand
```

---

### Issue 5: Upload Stalls at 50%

**Symptoms:** Progress bar stops, no error

**Causes:**
- Slow internet connection
- Large file
- Presigned URL expired (> 60 seconds)

**Fix:**
Increase URL expiration in `server/routes/uploadRoutes.js`:
```javascript
const uploadUrl = await getSignedUrl(s3, command, { 
  expiresIn: 300  // Change from 60 to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
});
```

router.get("/presign", protect, async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.user._id;
  // Associate uploads with user
});
```

### 2. Add File Restrictions
```javascript
// Limit file size to 10MB
if (fileSize > 10 * 1024 * 1024) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: "File too large" });
}

// Allow only specific types
const ALLOWED = ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "application/pdf"];
if (!ALLOWED.includes(fileType)) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: "File type not allowed" });
}
```

### 3. Integrate with Features
